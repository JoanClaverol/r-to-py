This project aims to translate all the job done by [Julia
Silge](https://juliasilge.com/) and [David
Robinson](https://github.com/dgrtwo) to python.

Each notebook will contain the code generated by Julia and David
(depending on the notebook), and an apdaptation to the `pandas` ,
`sklearn` and `mapltotlib/seaborn` .
